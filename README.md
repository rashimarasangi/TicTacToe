# TicTacToe

A classic Ticâ€“Tacâ€“Toe game built using **React** + **Vite**.

## ðŸŽ® Project Overview

This is a simple yet fun implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

The project was built to practice modern front-end tooling (React + Vite), component structure, state management, and styling.

## ðŸ§° Features

- Two-player local gameplay (Player X vs Player O)  
- Detects a winner (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)  
- Detects a draw when no moves left  
- Clean, responsive UI for a 3Ã—3 grid  
- Built with React functional components and hooks  
- Powered by Vite for fast build and development  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rashimarasangi/TicTacToe.git  
   cd TicTacToe  
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
